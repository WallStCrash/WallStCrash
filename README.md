- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WallStCrash.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in a few languages for different purposes. After struggling on a C++ Module at university, I only got into progamming later, via self-learning VBA, R and MySQL for work purposes. My main interests in this area are for data analysis of GIS, financial and economic data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, focusing on excel task automation.
